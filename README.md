a)	This algorithm looks through a list to see if it has any duplicates. If a duplicate is found the algorithm will end.
b)	The worst caste running time of the algorithm is quadratic because the highest exponent of this algorithm is 2.
c)	The algorithm is still correct because the algorithm is still searching for i in line three, and now that it changed in line 4 it will still work as it is searching through -1.
d)	The algorithm will search through twice as fast because at the same time they are searching from the top to bottom and bottom to top so its much quicker as these two will meet each other half way through, whereas before it was just going from bottom to up.
